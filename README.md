# About 🔖

- MEV Shanghai is a MEV-focused event that combines a 7-day Research House with 2 days of side events during the [Shanghai International Blockchain Week](https://x.com/WXblockchain/status/1802607014595674207).
- The side events will be hosted **on October 15th and 16th**, with the theme “MEV Supply Chain” and “MEV Re-distribution”.
- The house will run from **October 10th to 17th.**
- MEV Shanghai is a forked MEV-themed event inspired by [MEV Tokyo](https://github.com/titania-research-labs/mev-tokyo/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file). We’re honored to have [Titania Research](https://titaniaresear.ch/) join us as our research support for this event.

# Theme - what do we care about? 🤔

We are focusing on the centralization concerns under Ethereum PoS design and how to mitigate them. That is to explore some open problems around these topics and discuss potential solutions to toxic MEV and centralized staking.

We may look into approach focused on trustless, decentralized roles in the supply chain: searcher, builder, relayer, proposer, and validator. For example, ePBS separates builder and proposer at the protocol level, removing the need for trust in relayers. And its variants like Slot-auction ePBS, Execution Auctions and Execution Tickets further decouple builder and proposer, capturing MEV at the protocol level. Solving centralized concerns in validator staking through Rainbow Staking, decentralizing proposer through MCP…

We may also look into approach aimed to prevent toxic MEV by using batch auctions on the application-layer and providing private transaction RPC on the supply chain...

Lastly, MEV value redistribution strategies include MEV share, order flow auction, and OEV capture, enabling users and applications to capture MEV, while MEV Burn allows MEV to be captured at the protocol level.

# Programs ✅

In general, we will have some in-house talk sessions, discussions, and collaborative research during the Research House. We’re also going to organize a 2-day side event open to the public.

## Research House (Oct 10th - 17th) 🏠︎

# House Pictures 🏡

The house has four private rooms and can accommodate up to 8 people. This means we’ll need to arrange accommodation for other housemates in nearby apartments. However, every housemate is welcome to stay at the house until bedtime for closer discussions.
